# HPC Job Failure Prediction – Deucalion Logs

This repository contains the pipeline developed to **predict job failures in a high-performance computing (HPC) environment** using production logs from the **Deucalion supercomputer**.

- **Source code**: all required scripts are located in the `scripts/` directory.  
- **Article**: reading [`Article.pdf`](./Article.pdf) is **highly recommended** for a full understanding of the methodology, technical choices, and results.

All experiments were designed and executed on Deucalion’s distributed cluster.
